# advent-of-code

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```

My solutions to advent of code 2023 using typescript and bun.sh. Might as well learn bun while doing this ðŸ˜….
I will probably include other solutions I come accross that i find interesting. But my solutions will always be named "day[DayIndex].ts"
